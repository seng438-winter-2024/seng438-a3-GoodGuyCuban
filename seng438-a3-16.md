# 1 Introduction

In this assignment, we dove into white-box testing techniques, exploring coverage metrics to gauge the effectiveness of our existing test suite. By designing new test cases using control-flow coverage metrics and analyzing data-flow coverage, we gained valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of coverage-based testing. This hands-on experience allowed us to enhancing our JUnit test suite by assessing the coverage of previous tests, reassessing test strategies, and improving the test suite.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

## Data Utilities Calculate Column Total

### Data Flow Graph:

**Def-Use Sets Per Statement**

To define the def-use sets per statement for the calculateColumnTotal method, we examine where each variable is defined and where it's used.

**data**: Defined as a parameter. **Used** in data.getRowCount() and data.getValue(row, column).

**column**: Defined as a parameter. **Used** in data.getValue(row, column).

**validRows**: Defined as a parameter. **Used** in the loop to get validRows\[v\].

**total**: Defined initially as 0.0, potentially redefined to 100 if total > 0 (which is never true given the initial definition), and updated within the loop with total += n.doubleValue().

**rowCount**: Defined with data.getRowCount(). Used in if (row < rowCount).

**v**: Defined at the beginning of the loop. **Used** to index validRows.

**row**: Defined as validRows\[v\]. **Used** in data.getValue(row, column).

**n**: Defined as data.getValue(row, column). **Used** in n != null and n.doubleValue().

**DU Pairs for calculateColumnTotal**

Given the definitions and uses above, the DU pairs for variables in calculateColumnTotal are:

**For total:**

*   (Definition of total, use in if (total > 0))
    
*   (Definition of total, use in total += n.doubleValue())
    
*   (Definition of total, return total)
    

**For rowCount:**

*   (Definition of rowCount, use in if (row < rowCount))
    

**For row:**

*   (Definition of row, use in data.getValue(row, column))
    

**For n:**

*   (Definition of n, use in total += n.doubleValue())

### Pairs Covered by Test Cases:

**DU Pairs Analysis FOR DATA UTILITIES**

**calculateColumnTotalForTwoPositiveValues**

**Covered DU Pairs:**

*   The definition of total at the start is used in total += n.doubleValue() for both mock values, covering (Definition of total, use in total += n.doubleValue()).
    
*   The definition of rowCount with data.getRowCount() is used in if (row < rowCount), covering (Definition of rowCount, use in if (row < rowCount)).
    
*   The definition of row in the loop is used in data.getValue(row, column), covering (Definition of row, use in data.getValue(row, column)).
    
*   The definition of n in the loop is used in total += n.doubleValue(), covering (Definition of n, use in total += n.doubleValue()).
    

**Not Covered Pairs**

*   The condition if (total > 0) is not covered because total starts from 0 and is only increased; it doesn't specifically test the path where total is initially greater than 0.
    
*   n as both null and non-null
    

**DU Coverage Calculation**

DU Pair Coverage = 4/6 = 0.6667 = 66.67 %

**calculateColumnTotalForThreeNegativeValues**

**Covered DU Pairs:**

**For total:**

*   The definition of total at the start is used in total += n.doubleValue() for all three mock values, covering: (Definition of total, use in total += n.doubleValue())
    
*   The return of total is covered, reflecting:
    

(Definition of total, return total)

**For rowCount:**

*   The definition of rowCount with data.getRowCount() is used in if (row < rowCount), covering:
    

(Definition of rowCount, use in if (row < rowCount))

**For row:**

*   The definition of row in the loop is used in data.getValue(row, column), covering:
    

(Definition of row, use in data.getValue(row, column))

**For n:**

*   The definition of n in the loop is used in total += n.doubleValue(), covering:
    

(Definition of n, use in total += n.doubleValue())

**Uncovered Pairs:**

*   The condition if (total > 0) is not covered because total starts from 0 and is only increased; it doesn't specifically test the path where total is initially greater than 
    
*   n as both null and non-null
    

DU Coverage Calculation

<img src="media/DuCalcAsset.PNG" alt="Formula" width="250"/>

DU Pair Coverage = 4/6 = 0.6667 = 66.67 %

**calculateColumnTotalWithLargeIndex**

This test follows the same logic of retrieving and adding values for the above 2 tests and so has the same DU coverage calculation of the above tests of **66.67 %.** As well as the same covered Pairs and uncovered Pairs

**calculateColumnTotalWithNullValues**

**Covered DU Pairs in this Test Case:**

**For total:**

*   The definition of total is used in total += n.doubleValue() when n is not null. However, in this test, one of the values is null, which means the addition operation is skipped for this value. Despite this, the initial definition of total and its use in the addition (for the non-null value) and its return are covered.
    

**For rowCount:**

*   The definition of rowCount with data.getRowCount() is used in if (row < rowCount), which is covered since the loop is entered.
    

**For row:**

*   The definition of row in the loop is used in data.getValue(row, column), which is covered for both the non-null and null value cases.
    

**For n:**

*   The definition of n as null for one of the values and as non-null (7.5). The test case covers the use of n in the conditional check for null (if (n != null)) and the subsequent addition to the total for the non-null case.
    

DU Coverage Calculation

<img src="media/DuCalcAsset.PNG" alt="Formula" width="250"/>

**2 (for total) + 1 (for rowCount) + 1 (for row) + 1 (for n) = 5 DU pairs covered out of 6 total DU pairs.**

DU Pair Coverage = 5/6 = 0.6667 = 83.33 %

**calculateColumnTotalWithNullAndNumericValues**

This test follows a similar logic to the above test where we test for null values and has the same DU coverage because we’re focusing on our functions capacity to handle null values. So the DU coverage is **83.33 %**

**calculateColumnTotalForEmptyMatrix**

**Covered DU Pairs**

**For total:**

*   The definition of total is not used in a modifying way (total += n.doubleValue() is never reached), but it is returned. (Definition of total, return total).
    

**For rowCount:**

*   The definition of rowCount does not lead to a use within the loop because the loop conditions are not met. However, its definition still occurs, so it's more about the lack of subsequent use due to the test case setup rather than not being covered.
    

**DU Coverage Calculation**

<img src="media/DuCalcAsset.PNG" alt="Formula" width="250"/>

**1 (for total)** 

**DU Pair Coverage = 1/6 = 0.1667 = 16.67 %**

**calculateColumnTotalForOutOfBoundsIndexBelow andcalculateColumnTotalForOutOfBoundsIndexAbove**

**Covered DU Pairs by Both Test Cases**

total is defined at the start with double total = 0.0; and is returned at the end without being modified due to the exception thrown by values.getValue(0, column). Thus, the (Definition of total, return total) DU pair is covered.

rowCount is defined with int rowCount = data.getRowCount();, but since the loop's execution leads to an exception (as per the test setup), the use of rowCount in the condition if (row < rowCount) is not considered in these tests

**DU Coverage Calculation**

<img src="media/DuCalcAsset.PNG" alt="Formula" width="250"/>

**1 (for total)** 

**DU Pair Coverage = 1/6 = 0.1667 = 16.67 %**

**Overall DU Pair Coverage of our Method:**
**\= 6/6 = 100%**

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

### Coverage Tool Used: EclEmma

Pros:
- Code Coverage: EclEmma provides detailed code coverage analysis, albeit missing some metrics, showing which parts of the code are being exercised by the tests.
- Integration with IDE: EclEmma is already installed and integrated into the Eclipse IDE, making it useful to incorporate into the workflow

Cons:
- Specific Analysis Limitations: EclEmma primarily focuses on runtime code coverage analysis and does not provide insights into some areas of the code that are not exercised during testing, such as error handling or edge cases.
- Missing metrics: EclEmma could be more helpful with providing specific insights or tips to help further improve test code.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

The difference between requirements-based and coverage-based testing lies in their approach to test case design. Requirements-based testing focuses on designing test cases based on the specified objectives or requirements of the class or methods, ensuring alignment with user expectations. This approach simplifies test case creation, as it doesn't require knowledge of the internal details of the methods being tested. However, a drawback of requirements-based testing is that it may miss covering certain statements or branches within the methods, potentially leading to program failure if these untested paths contain errors that are executed by users. Coverage-based testing, on the other hand, analyzes the source code of the methods themselves to ensure criteria such as statement and branch coverage are satisfied. By tracking metrics within the source code, coverage-based testing aims to minimize untested code paths, thereby reducing the risk of undetected errors. However, coverage-based testing focuses primarily on code quality rather than meeting user expectations, which can result in overlooking important user requirements. Additionally, implementing coverage-based tests can be more time-consuming compared to requirements-based testing due to its comprehensive nature. Also, during our lab, we found that by striving to improve our coverage for our test cases, we were able to write better test cases compared to when we were only considering requirements-based testing. This approach helped us identify areas of the code that were not adequately covered and allowed us to create more comprehensive test suites. However, we also observed that achieving high coverage can be challenging and time-consuming, requiring careful consideration of various code paths and scenarios. Despite these challenges, the insights gained from coverage-based testing were valuable in enhancing the overall quality of our test suite and improving our confidence in the reliability of the software.


# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

For this assignment, our team divided into two groups, with one pair focusing on coverage testing for Range, and the other pair for DataUtilities class. Within each group, we worked collaboratively in pairs to evaluate specific methods. We ensured comprehensive coverage for a minimum of five methods per class. After completing individual tasks, we conducted peer reviews within each group to validate test methods and made sure we stuck to testing strategies and Javadoc requirements. Also, we held a review session as a full team to further validate and refine our test suites. Through this collaborative approach, we effectively managed equal workload distribution.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

One significant challenge was ensuring that our test suites achieved the desired coverage metrics while adhering to the Javadoc requirements and testing strategies. This required close collaboration and communication within our teams to identify gaps in coverage and develop effective test cases to address them. However, we found it challenging to find suitable times for everyone to collaborate together, given our different schedules and commitments. Through effective communication and coordination, we managed to overcome this obstacle and ensure that all team members were able to contribute effectively to the project.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab provided a comprehensive introduction to white-box testing techniques and tools, with clear instructions for setting up the testing environment in Eclipse.  However, it could have been beneficial to include clearer documentation on code coverage tools like EclEmma. Overall, the lab offered valuable hands-on experience in testing methodologies, but additional guidance on coverage tool usage could have enhanced the learning experience.
