# 1 Introduction

In this assignment, we bolstered our JUnit test suite by moving onto white box testing by:
1. Assessed the coverage of previous tests.
2. Reassessed test strategies.
3. Improved the test suite. 

This lab report compiles our unit testing strategies and the test cases that followed, including their results. 

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method 
(a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Lets write down a big list of items:

### Requirements-based Testing
Advantages:
- Ensures software adheres to specifications
- Tests focus on regularly used features

Disadvantages:
- Requires clear, unchanging documentation
- Not good at catching edge cases
- Resource intensive, especially for complex systems

### Coverage-based Testing
Advantages:
- Provides quantitative metrics for analysing code
- Easily automated

Disadvantages:
- Doesn't focus on program's requirements
- Not good at catching complicated errors 
- Can create false sense of "completeness"
